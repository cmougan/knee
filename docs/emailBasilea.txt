Dear Marcus, Desiree,
 
I add the results of the latest magnetic resonances of two articulations, plus my symptoms.
 
I am looking forward to meeting the Thursday, 30.11.2023 at 13:00.
 
I hope you find the following analysis useful. I have directly translated using deepl.com Let me know if there is anything else I can provide.
 
Shoulder
 
Arthrography 12/2022 [link]
Extensive tear involving the hyaline cartilage and labrum of the anteroinferior quadrant of the glenoid.
 
Surgery
It is operated under arthroscopic surgery on 31.1.23 showing complete disinsertion of anteroinferior labrum, wide chondral lesion at the level of the glenoid and Kim's lesion. Arthroscopic technique of reinsertion of labrum and cartilage with Iconix anchors 1.4 mm (3) and partial resection of flapinferior by Kim's lesion is performed. It is immobilized with Sling.
 
Arthrography 10/2023 [link]
Post-surgical changes secondary to anteroinferior labral reconstruction, without data of retear.
Hyaline cartilage lesion of the anteroinferior quadrant of the glenoid persists.
Mild-moderate supraspinatus tendinopathy, associated with a small PASTA-type partial tear.
 
Current symptoms: It's been 10 months since surgery, I am gradually doing more sports but with articulation pain. It's unclear if the pain will persist or not through time, nor if i twill degrade.
 
 
Knee
MR 11/2020 [link]
Chondromalacia patella grade II-III. Thickening of the quadricipital tendon. There are no significant alterations in the patellar tendon. Chondral lesion of beginning in the plateau
external tibial plateau
 
Arthroscopy  04/2023
On April 28, 2023, a right knee arthroscopy was performed. There was a grade 1 chondral injury on the inner facet of the patella and a  cartilage fissure on the outer plateau. Motorized shaving of the chondral lesions was carried out.
 
MR 11/2023 [link]
Chondromalacia patellae grade II-III, stable.
Focal cracking of the cartilage of the inferior margin of the external aspect of the trochlear groove,
grade III focalDF.
 
 
 
Symptoms:  I have been experiencing daily pain for over 3 years. The pain tolerance to sport has decreased. Few years ago I could do normal sport and have pain. Today if I run 10 mins I have pain, if I bike 10 mins I have pain, if I do 50 squats I have pain. This level of pain impacts moderetaly my quality of life, e.g. sitting.
 
During +1000 days I have annotated in a database pain, and sport activity.
 
I have used this data to evaluate wether if treatments suchs rehabilitation, pharma, PRP or an arthrocopy have effect. The result is that no treatment has effect.
 
My interpretation:
I have a small/minimal knee cartilage lession that is increasingly painful and affects my quality of life.
I have a more complicated shoulder lession whose impact on my life or degeneration is still unclear.
 
 
Kind regards,
Carlos Mougan

Dear Carlos,

 

online will be less precise as the clinical examination is quite important. I will ask my secretary to schedule an appointment for online meeting. It would be important to have surgical report and ideally a new MRI after surgery.

 

Best regards

Dear Marcus,

Many thanks for your answer! Yes, I will be interested.
Unfortunately, I am doing research abroad at the moment. Would it be possible to make it online? I do have most information digitalized.
 
In this link a magnetic resonance [link].
I did an arthroscopy in April’23.  What I seem to have in weight-bearing cartilage of the knee is a small fissure and on the other side a chondromalacia level 2. Which they cleaned during the arthroscopy.
I do have a full chondral lesion in the shoulder but I believe it's out of scope.
 
From the clinical perspective, what I have is increasing pain over the last 3-4 years. Currently is constant pain/inflammation of the knee.

In this figure the pain evolution since 2021.
 
I have been maintaining two databases, one with pain annotations [link], other with the exercise[link]. Which has helped me to generate this report [link]
 
As for therapies, I have tried PRP, hyaluronic acid, pharma, and different types of rehabilitation. None has been successful.
 
This has impacted me from going from a professional sports life to performing basic rehabilitation exercises.
 
How else can I help?
 
Kind regards,

Dear Mr Mougan, thank you for your email and your interest. I could offer an outpatient service appointment, which should help us to understand what is the problem in your knee. This includes clinical examination and evaluating the radiological imaging. Please let me know if you wish to proceed in that way. 

 

Best regards, Marcus Mumme

Dear Carlos,
 
Thanks for the new message and interest in our clinical studies, beyond their connection with AI.
 
I’m CC’ing here Dr. Marcus Mumme, who coordinates clinical treatments with our procedure. He will get in touch with you to verify the eligibility of your case for the ongoing trials.
 
Thanks again, all the best… and maybe we’ll have more chances to discuss about possible scientific interactions!
 
All the best
 
Ivan

Dear Ivan, I would be interested in joining if possible a clinical trial. The shoulder is quite clear. For the knee, I have a small fissure (I know by arthroscopy), that seems to be degrading. I have been systematically annotating the symptomatology

It’s a pain that has retired me from most sports activity.
I am asking because I have tried almost all the resources around me.
 
Perhaps this “rigorous” methodology can also help with the development, even though N=1.
 
Kind regards,

DearCarlos,
 
thank you for the update, matching the one received by Andrea. 
Whenever we develop a specific need / question which we recognize could be addressed with your methodology, we will not hesitate to get in touch with you - now that the channel is open.
 
In the meantime, I wish you all the best for the cartilage lesion… in a couple of years we will have data also related to application of our therapeutic strategy into the shoulder.
 
All the very best
 
Ivan

Dear Ivan,
Many thanks for introducing Andrea. After some discussion with him, from my perspective, only if getting access to the full database (https://string-db.org/), it may be worth applying AI. I also guess someone has already tried.
I tend to assess data with a similar structure to this publication(Fig2 of attached), then, if I understood correctly:
Appropriate: Data does seem to be only partially appropriate for the research question. The graph is built on previous related work rather than on the process to be modeled.
Readiness: The structure of the raw data may not be a perfect fit for the learning algorithm. It requires further exploring.
Reliability: The data is very biased as it is built around previous publications. So this will hinder outcomes and conclusions.
Sensitivity: Its open source.
Sufficiency: The full database seems appropriate size. 
The problem might be suitable, but it requires further analysis of the data, and the usefulness of the potential outcome.
Why am I interested? I have a small fissure in the knee cartilage[linkRM], which has been creating paing for 3y, during this time, I have tried to apply AI to correlate sports activity/PRP/pharma to pain symptoms[link], with Little success. In the shoulder I have a full-thickness chondral lesion[link], they both come from sports traumas.
I would like to see if I can contribute to the field with my experience and knowledge of AI to accelerate or unblock processes. It may not be possible.
Kind regards,
Carlos Mougan

Dear Carlos,
 
thank you for the spontaneous contact and interest in our work.
I’m CC’ing this reply to Dr. Andrea Mainardi, an experienced postdoc (PhD in biomedical engineering) in my group who is developing a microfluidic system to investigate mechanisms of cartilage degeneration and to test strategies for cartilage regeneration. He is dealing with ‘big data’ and would be keen to get in touch with you to hear what the field of AI could offer
 
Please feel free to get in touch with him and have a chat
 
Thanks again, all the very best

Dear Ivan,
 
I am Carlos Mougan, a Marie Curie researcher on applied AI.
 
Unfortunately, recently I have become very interested in cartilage regeneration.
 
I was reading your last nature review and I was left wondering if AI techniques could be applied to understand more about cartilage biology.
 
I would love to help and contribute.
Please let me know if you consider that I could be of any help.
 
Kind regards,
