Hi Johanna,

Unfortunately, recently I became interested in cartilage regeneration. I attempted to read the paper up to my limits. I noted that in the Figure 7 says "implants" while in the rest of the paper talks about "inyections".

I was wondering if the research is ongoing and looking for patients or open to public?

I also wonder if I could contribute to the research with my AI modeling experience.

Kind regards,

Carlos, thank you for your message! Indeed, the 'label' implants was uses as name for the clinical study protocol, hence also in the paper, but these were indeed also IA injections. We are currently finishing of the toxicity and dosing studies to get FDA approval to start our first phase 1 clinical trial. AI would absolutely be of interest here, please tell me more about your research experience and envisions!

Kind regards,

Johanna

A summary of my experience is around LinkedIn. I have applied AI in sectors such as finance, news, socialmedia, insurance, central banking, nuclear physics weather forecasting... Wrt to healthcare, we did a project about glaucomma detection and provided explainations to MD. Most of my experience is around tabular data.

Related to your challenges probably the position that I hold at the Alan Turing is the most interesting. I provide techincal advice for projects between academia and industry to ensure that AI applications have a chance of being succesful and align expectations.

For OA and cartilage regeneration I have very limited knowledge about the therapy so is hard for me to say. I dont see where you have data to apply AI. In the paper there are only 9 cases. In the Nature that summarizes yours I found "an additional goal will be to develop a predictive model to correlate OA grade or characteristics to the required number of treatments," which seems a potential use case for AI.

From my experience these kind of things require a lot of interdisciplinary work as it's hard to align what is feasible to achieve with AI with what its useful.

I will be up for a quick meeting to discuss.
