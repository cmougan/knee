Hi Johanna,

Unfortunately, recently I became interested in cartilage regeneration. I attempted to read the paper up to my limits. Why in the table of Figure 7 says "implants" and not "inyections"?

Is the research ongoing and looking for patients or open to public?

I also wonder if I could contribute to the research with my AI modeling experience.

Kind regards,
Carlos Mougan
